Subject: Urgent Security Advisory: Remote Code Execution Exploiting ssc_upcase Library 

Dear Dr. Mark, 

We hope this message reaches you promptly. Following our previous communication
regarding the buffer overflow in the ssc_upcase() function within the ssc_upcase library, we regret to inform you of an escalated security concern. Reports indicate that other customers of the same library have experienced instances of remote code execution, and it has come to our attention that the identified buffer overflow is actively being exploited on the internet. \\

Our security team is working around the clock to address this critical situation and develop comprehensive patches to mitigate the risk. However, in the meantime, we strongly advise you to implement the following general
measures to protect against remote exploitation: 

    Network Segmentation: Isolate systems running the affected ssc\_upcase library to minimize potential exposure to malicious actors.

    Firewall Configuration: Ensure that firewalls are configured to restrict
    unnecessary network traffic and closely monitor inbound and outbound
    connections.

    Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Deploy and configure IDS to detect and alert on any suspicious activity, particularly related to attempts at exploiting the buffer overflow vulnerability. 

    Regular Backups: Maintain up-to-date backups of critical data and systems to
    facilitate quick recovery in the event of a compromise. 
    
    Update Security Software: Ensure that all security software, including
    antivirus and intrusion prevention systems, is updated to the latest versions. 

We understand the urgency of this matter and assure you that our development
team is expediting the release of patches to address both the buffer overflow
and the reported instances of remote code execution. We will communicate a
detailed timeline for the release of these patches as soon as possible. 

We sincerely apologize for any disruption or concern this may cause and
appreciate your immediate attention to these precautionary measures. Should you
have any questions or require further assistance, please contact our support
team. 

Thank you for your understanding and continued trust in SSC. 

Best regards,
SSC Security Team
